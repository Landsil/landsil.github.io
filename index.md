### Portfolio

Please consider this page a learning and showcase project. It will both link some things I'm proud off, some thinks people can find usefull and also things I have to share to be motivated to continue working on them.
1. 3 to 5 of my most interesting GitHub repositories will be here.
2. Some GitPages pages with markdown ( this one ) html and css ( TODO )
3. Some "website alternatives" showcase
4. Some actual external websites with other initiatives
