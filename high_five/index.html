      The High Five Game illustrates the randomness involved in teaching tricks to a cat. The project's inspiration is called <a href='https://www.instagram.com/jacketpotatocat/'>Jack</a>; he's been learning this command since he was a kitten, but the results of any given exercise are hit-and-miss, with a treat increasing your odds. Jack thinks "high five" means "free treats", and is there anything wrong with that?
     <br><br>
      The game has a hidden motivation stat; offering the hand randomly decreases the cat's motivation, while offering treats randomly increases it. But be careful not to overfeed!
