# Podcast Scripts
This will be both exercise in html and list of scripts I've made for the podcast ( that are in themselves training ). As everything is past of Github Pages you can go and look at the exact code that makes everything work. For the moment I'm using some "dumb" html gnerator with some CSS and obwiusly w3schools articles.
